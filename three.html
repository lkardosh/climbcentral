			<h2> History </h2>

				<h3 class="aCombo"> Rock climbing was a key part of Victorian mountaineering in the 1800s. 
					However, it only became popular as a recreational activity near the end of the 19th century. It was first labeled 
					as a sport in the 1880s as more attention was brought to it.
					In 1910 more rope handling techniques and carabiners were developed, giving climbers access to climbs that had once seemed impossible.		
					<br>
					<br>
					The first climbing competitions	were organized in the former USSR in the late 1940s,
					making rock climbing into a more defined sport.	It was not until 1985 that the first organized competition
					for modern sport climbing occurred. This event was called SportRoccia and featured some of the world's best climbers.
					In 1991, the first World Championship was organized in Frankfurt, Germany.
					Rock climbing has continued to increase in popularity as different grade difficulties were developed.
